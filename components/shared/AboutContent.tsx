          We&apos;re just two normal dudes who met in a classroom, probably
          while trying to look interested in a lecture. We didn&apos;t chat
          about Fetan back then, but it became clear we both had a shared
          passion for coding and a knack for turning random ideas into reality.
          Fast forward a few coding marathons and a lot of ‚ÄúWhat if we did
          this?‚Äù moments, and Fetan was born. We noticed that Ethiopian banks
          didn&apos;t have an API for their exchange rates and thought,
          &quot;Seriously, someone&apos;s got to fix this!&quot; So we did. With
          our free API, developers can now fetch daily bank rates without all
          the usual headaches. We&apos;re just two guys who wanted to make life
          easier for developers (and maybe have a bit of fun while doing it). We
          are cooking up something ! Buckle up‚ÄîFetan is just getting started,
          and the ride&apos;s going to be a blast! üöÄ

          Fetan is crafted by developers who know the struggles of finding
          reliable data. That&apos;s why we created it with developers in
          mind‚Äîbecause we&apos;ve been in your shoes and understand what you
          need. Our API is completely free (till mongodb charges us) and open
          source, giving you access to real-time exchange rates without any
          hidden costs. We believe in the power of open data and making tools
          accessible for everyone. After all, who doesn&apos;t love a free API
          that simplifies your work and makes life a little easier? At Fetan,
          we&apos;re all about supporting the developer community and providing
          a resource that&apos;s as straightforward and useful as possible.
